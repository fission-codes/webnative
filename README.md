Fission provides app hosting with user controlled data. We‚Äôre building a web native file system that combines files, encryption, and identity, like an open source iCloud.

Get started making fission-enabled apps with the Fission SDK!


## What you'll find here

The Fission SDK offers tools for:
- authenticating through a Fission **authentication lobby**  
  (a lobby is where you can make a Fission account or link an account)
- managing your web native **file system**
- tools for building DIDs and UCANs.

```js
// ES6
import sdk from 'fission-sdk'

// Browser/UMD build
self.fissionSdk
```

You'll also find some helper functions for interacting with some of the building blocks:
- [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) for distributed file storage
- [keystore-idb](https://github.com/fission-suite/keystore-idb) for key management, encryption & digital signatures



# Authentication

[auth.fission.codes](https://auth.fission.codes) is our authentication lobby, where you'll be able to make a Fission an account and link with another account that's on another device or browser.

```js
const auth = await sdk.isAuthenticated()

if (auth.cancelled) {
  // User was redirected to lobby,
  // but cancelled the authorisation.

} else if (auth.newUser) {
  // This authenticated user is new to Fission.

} else if (auth.authenticated) {
  // Authenticated üçø
  //
  // additional data:
  // auth.throughLobby  -  If the user authenticated through the lobby, or just came back.
  // auth.username      -  User's username

} else {
  // Not authenticated üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  sdk.redirectToLobby()

}
```

`redirectToLobby` takes an optional parameter, the url that the lobby should redirect back to (the default is `location.href`).


## Other functions

- `await sdk.deauthenticate()`
- `await sdk.authenticatedUsername()`



# File System

The Web Native File System (WNFS) is built on top of IPFS. It's structured and functions similarly to a Unix-style file system, with one notable exception: it's a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), meaning that a given child can have more than one parent (think symlinks but without the "sym").

Each file system has a public tree and a private tree. All information (links, data, metadata, etc) in the private tree is encrypted. Decryption keys are stored in such a manner that access to a given folder grants access to all of its subfolders.


## Basics

WNFS exposes a familiar POSIX-style interface:
- `add`: add a file
- `cat`: retrieve a file
- `ls`: list a directory
- `mkdir`: create a directory
- `mv`: move a file or directory
- `rm`: remove a file or directory


## Versions

Since the file system may evolve over time, a "version" is associated with each node in the file system (tracked with semver).

Currently two versions exist:
- `1.0.0`: file tree with metadata. Nodes in the file tree are structured as 2 layers where one layer contains "header" information (metadata, cache, etc), and the second layer contains data or links. **This is the default version, use this unless you have a good reason not to**.
- `0.0.0`: bare file tree. The public tree consists of [ipfs dag-pg](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-dag-pb) nodes. The private tree is encrypted links with no associated metadata. These should really only be used for vanity links to be rendered by a gateway.


## API

### Config

Each instantiation method takes an optional config. Below is the default config and descriptions of each value.

```ts
const defaultConfig = {
  keyName: 'filesystem-root', // the name of the key for the filesystem root as stored in IndexedDB
  version: '1.0.0' // the version of the filesystem as discussed above
}
```
---

### Instantiation

**empty**

Creates a file system with an empty public tree & an empty private tree at the root

Params:
- cfg: `FileSystemConfig` _optional_

Returns: `FileSystem` instance

Example:
```ts
import FileSystem from 'fission-sdk/fs'
const wnfs = await FileSystem.empty()
```

---

**fromCID**

Loads an existing file system from a CID

Params:
- cid: `CID` (`string`) **required**
- cfg: `FileSystemConfig` _optional_

Returns: `FileSystem` instance

Example:
```ts
import FileSystem from 'fission-sdk/fs'
const cid = "QmWKst5WVNTPfMsSFCQEJYBJLEsUZfghqrKXJBVU4EuA76"
const wnfs = await FileSystem.fromCID(cid)
```

---

**forUser**

Loads an existing file system from a username

Params:
- username: `string` **required**
- cfg: `FileSystemConfig` _optional_

Returns: `FileSystem` instance

Example:
```ts
import FileSystem from 'fission-sdk/fs'
const wnfs = await FileSystem.forUser("boris")
```

---

### Methods

Methods for interacting with the filesystem all use **absolute** paths. We're planning on adding a [stateful session](https://github.com/fission-suite/ts-sdk/issues/24) but for now, filesystem state will need to be tracked in your application.

**add**

Adds some file content at a given path

Params:
- path: `string` **required**
- content: `FileContent` (`object | string | Blob | Buffer`) **required**

Returns: `CID` the updated _root_ CID for the file system

Example:
```ts
const content = "hello world"
const updatedCID = await wnfs.add("public/some/path/to/a/file", content)
// creates a file called "file" at "public/some/path/to/a"
```

---

**cat**

Retrieves some file content at a given path

Params:
- path: `string` **required**

Returns: `FileContent` (`object | string | Blob | Buffer`)

Example:
```ts
const content = await wnfs.cat("public/some/path/to/a/file")
```

---

**get**

Retrieves the node at the given path, either a `File` or `Tree` object

Params:
- path: `string` **required**

Returns: `Tree | File | null`

Example:
```ts
const node = await wnfs.get("public/some/path")
```

---

**ls**

Returns a list of links at a given directory path

Params:
- path: `string` **required**

Returns: `Links[]` list of links

Example:
```ts
// public
const links = await wnfs.ls("public/some/directory/path")
// private
const links = await wnfs.ls("private/some/directory/path")
```

---

**mkdir**

Creates a directory at the given path

Params:
- path: `string` **required**

Returns: `CID` the updated _root_ CID for the file system

Example:
```ts
const updatedCID = await wnfs.mkdir("public/some/directory/path")
// creates a directory called "path" at "public/some/directory"
```

---

**mv**

Move a directory or file from one path to another

Params:
- pathA: `string` **required**
- pathB: `string` **required**

Returns: `CID` the updated _root_ CID for the file system

Example:
```ts
const updatedCID = await wnfs.mv("public/doc.md", "private/Documents/notes.md")
```

---

**pinList**

Retrieves an array of all CIDs that need to be pinned in order to backup the FS.

Params: _none_

Returns: `CID[]`

Example:
```ts
const allCIDs = await wnfs.pinList()
```

---

**rm**

Removes a file or directory at a given path

Params:
- path: `string` **required**

Returns: `CID` the updated _root_ CID for the file system

Example:
```ts
const updatedCID = await wnfs.rm("private/some/path/to/a/file")
```

---

**sync**

Ensures the latest version of the file system is added to IPFS and returns the root CID

Params: _none_

Returns: `CID` the updated _root_ CID for the file system

Example:
```ts
const rootCID = await wnfs.sync()
```



# Customisation

Customisation can be done using the `setup` module.
Run these before anything else you do with the SDK.

```js
// custom api, lobby, and/or user domain
// (no need to specify each one)
sdk.setup.endpoints({
  api: "https://my.fission.api",
  lobby: "https://my.fission.lobby",
  user: "my.domain"
})

// js-ipfs options
// (see docs in src for more info)
sdk.setup.ipfs({ init: { repo: "my-ipfs-repo" } })
```



# Building Blocks

**Warning: Here be üêâ! Only use lower level utilities if you know what you're doing.**

This library is built on top of [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) and [keystore-idb](https://github.com/fission-suite/keystore-idb). If you have already integrated an ipfs daemon or keystore-idb into your web application, you probably don't want to have two instances floating around.

You can use one instance for your whole application by doing the following:
```ts
import ipfs from 'fission-sdk/ipfs'

// get the ipfs instance that the Fission SDK is using
const ipfsInstance = await ipfs.get()

// OR set the ipfs to an instance that you already have
await ipfs.set(ipfsInstance)

```

```ts
import keystore from 'fission-sdk/keystore'

// get the keystore instance that the Fission SDK is using
const keystoreInstance = await keystore.get()

// OR set the keystore to an instance that you already have
await keystore.set(keystoreInstance)
```
