# Webnative API Reference

[version](/modules/common_version.html#VERSION)

This is source-derived, auto-generated API reference for [webnative](https://github.com/fission-suite/webnative).

If you need an introduction to webnative, we recommend reading the [fission guide](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative) instead. This document is meant to be used as API reference.

## Which Docs to Look At

When you import webnative like this:
```js
import * as webnative from "webnative"
```

or like this:

```js
const webnative = require("webnative")
```

or using a script tag:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/webnative@latest/dist/index.umd.min.js">
```

Then you'll have a `webnative` variable at disposal which contains the [`index` module](/modules/index.html).

Once you've loaded a filesystem, you'll have an instance of the [`FileSystem` class](/classes/fs_filesystem.FileSystem.html). Read its docs to see what filesystem operations are supported.
