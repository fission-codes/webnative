The agent is responsible for signing UCANs that are sent to other services. This is not done by the identifier so that the identifier doesn't need to sign things each time. The reason this is useful is because an identifier might need to ask the user for permission to sign, whereas the agent does not. That means the user isn't bothered with popups every few minutes when for example the remote data root is updated.
